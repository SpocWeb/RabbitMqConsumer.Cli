# RabbitMqConsumer.Cli
This is a minimal Example for a Windows Service hosting a MassTransit Consumer in .NET Framework 4.8

It uses some extension Methods in XMassTransit.cs to make it easier 
to register all Consumers in a given List of Assemblies. 

This also demonstrates how to Run a generic Host in .NET FW 4.8 

Comments in Program.cs explain how to avoid possible Pitfalls.
